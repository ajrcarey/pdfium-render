/// A single `PdfPageObject` of type `PdfPageObjectType::Path`. The page object defines a path.
///
/// Paths define shapes, trajectories, and regions of all sorts. They are used to draw
/// lines, define the shapes of filled areas, and specify boundaries for clipping other
/// graphics. A path is composed of one or more _path segments_, each specifying
/// a straight or curved line segment. Each segment may connect to one another, forming a
/// _closed sub-path_, or may be disconnected from one another, forming one or more
/// _open sub-paths_. A path therefore is made up of one or more disconnected sub-paths, each
/// comprising a sequence of connected segments. Closed sub-paths can be filled;
/// both closed and open sub-paths can be stroked. The topology of the path is unrestricted;
/// it may be concave or convex, may contain multiple sub-paths representing disjoint areas,
/// and may intersect itself in arbitrary ways.
///
/// Page objects can be created either attached to a `PdfPage` (in which case the page object's
/// memory is owned by the containing page) or detached from any page (in which case the page
/// object's memory is owned by the object). Page objects are not rendered until they are
/// attached to a page; page objects that are never attached to a page will be lost when they
/// fall out of scope.
///
/// The simplest way to create a path object that is immediately attached to a page is to call
/// one of the `PdfPageObjects::create_path_object_*()` functions to create lines, cubic Bézier curves,
/// rectangles, circles, and ellipses. Alternatively you can create a detached path object using
/// one of the following functions, but you must add the object to a containing `PdfPageObjects`
/// collection manually.
///
/// * [PdfPagePathObject::new()]: creates an empty detached path object. Segments can be added to the
///   path by sequentially calling one or more of the [PdfPagePathObject::move_to()],
///   [PdfPagePathObject::line_to()], or [PdfPagePathObject::bezier_to()] functions.
///   A closed sub-path can be created by calling the [PdfPagePathObject::close_path()]
///   function. Convenience functions for adding rectangles, circles, and ellipses are also
///   available with the [PdfPagePathObject::rect_to()], [PdfPagePathObject::circle_to()],
///   and [PdfPagePathObject::ellipse_to()] functions, which create the desired shapes by
///   constructing closed sub-paths from other path segments.
/// * [PdfPagePathObject::new_line()]: creates a detached path object initialized with a single straight line.
/// * [PdfPagePathObject::new_bezier()]: creates a detached path object initialized with a single cubic Bézier curve.
/// * [PdfPagePathObject::new_rect()]: creates a detached path object initialized with a rectangular path.
/// * [PdfPagePathObject::new_circle()]: creates a detached path object initialized with a circular path,
///   filling the given rectangle.
/// * [PdfPagePathObject::new_circle_at()]: creates a detached path object initialized with a circular path,
///   centered at a particular origin point with a given radius.
/// * [PdfPagePathObject::new_ellipse()]: creates a detached path object initialized with an elliptical path,
///   filling the given rectangle.
/// * [PdfPagePathObject::new_ellipse_at()]: creates a detached path object initialized with an elliptical path,
///   centered at a particular origin point with given horizontal and vertical radii.
