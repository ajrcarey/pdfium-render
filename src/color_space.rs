/// The color space of any displayable object on a `PdfPage`.
///
/// Colors can be described in any of a variety of color systems called _color spaces_.
/// Some color spaces are related to device color representation (e.g. grayscale, RGB, CMYK);
/// others are related to human visual perception.
///
/// Color spaces can be classified into _color space families_. Spaces within a family
/// share the same general characteristics. Families fall into three broad categories:
///
/// * **Device color spaces** directly specify colors or shades of gray that the output
///   device is to produce. The precise displayed color is device-specific and is not calibrated.
///   Color space families in this category include [PdfColorSpace::DeviceGray],
///   [PdfColorSpace::DeviceRGB], and [PdfColorSpace::DeviceCMYK].
/// * **Calibrated color spaces** are based on international standards for specifying human-visible
///   colors created by the Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage (International Commission on
///   Illumination) and the International Color Consortium. The precise displayed color is
///   device-independent; it does not rely on the characteristics of any particular output device.
///   Color space families in this category include [PdfColorSpace::CalibratedCIEGray],
///   [PdfColorSpace::CalibratedCIERGB], [PdfColorSpace::CalibratedCIELab], and
///   [PdfColorSpace::CalibratedICCProfile].
/// * **Special color spaces** add features or properties to another color space, such as
///   patterns, color mapping, separations, and high-fidelity and/or multi-tone color.
///   Color space families in this category include [PdfColorSpace::Pattern],
///   [PdfColorSpace::Indexed], [PdfColorSpace::Separation], and [PdfColorSpace::DeviceN].
///
/// Non-RGB color spaces typically define a transform that enables color values in the color
/// space to be converted to an RGB approximation for on-screen display.
///
/// For more information on color spaces and their utilisation in PDF files, see Section 4.5
/// of the PDF Reference Manual version 1.7, starting on page 235.
