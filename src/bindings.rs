/// `FPDF_*()` function that takes an `FPDF_WIDESTRING`, and an additional `FPDF_*_str()` helper function
/// that takes a standard Rust `&str` and converts it internally to an `FPDF_WIDESTRING` before calling
/// Pdfium. Examples of functions with additional `_str()` helpers include `FPDFBookmark_Find()`,
/// `FPDFAnnot_SetStringValue()`, and `FPDFText_SetText()`.
